	 *  Default: path of page where the cookie was created.
	 *  Note regarding Internet Explorer:
	 *  Due to an obscure bug in the underlying WinINET InternetGetCookie implementation, IEâ€™s document.cookie will not return a cookie if it was set with a path attribute containing a filename. (From Internet Explorer Cookie Internals (FAQ)).
	 *  This means one cannot set a path using path: window.location.pathname in case such pathname contains a filename like so: /check.html (or at least, such cookie cannot be read correctly).
